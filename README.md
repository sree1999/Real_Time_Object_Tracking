# Real_Time_Object_Tracking

- Developed a real-time object tracking device, which with sufficient resources, can be modified to an intelligent border defense system with automatic aiming, targeting, and triggering.
- Built a hardware system with Raspberry Pi microcontroller which moves the servomotors (connected with a laser for pointing the target) corresponding to the pan and tilt angles.
