# Real_Time_Object_Tracking

Developed a real-time red-colored object tracking device, which with sufficient time and resources, can be modified to an intelligent border defense system with automatic aiming, targeting, and triggering.

After obtaining the real-time input from the web-camera, features are extracted from the frame to determine the position of the intruder/object.

Built a separate hardware system coupled through a serial port, for tracking the intruder/object. For targeting, servo motors were used along with a buzzer and a laser light for pointing the target.
